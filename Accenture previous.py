# Program 10 - Email ID Obfuscation (Category: Difficult)
# Personal information like email id and other contact details need to be handled in a way so that privacy of the user is safeguarded. One way to do this is to hide or partially hide such information, also called obfuscation of the information.
# Given the email id as input, the program should obfuscate the id as follows:
# 1) For the given mail id, the part that comes before @ is referred to as the first part. If there is no first @ character, the mail id is invalid.
# 2) If the first part of the email id is less than or equal to 5 characters in length, replace all characters in the first part with *
# 3) If the first of the email id is greater than 5 characters in length, print the first 3 characters as it is and replace the remaining characters of the first part with *
# 4) If the email id is invalid, print Invalid Input.
# Example 1:
# Input:
# abc@gmail.com
# Output:
# ***@gmail.com


n=input().split("@")
re=''
r=''
if len(n) <2:
    print("Invalid")
else:
    if len(first) <= 5:
        re = '*' * len(first)
    else:
        re = first[:3] + '*' * (len(first) - 3)
    
print(re + '@' + domain)

# Program 2: Table of Numbers

# Program 3
# Instructions: You are required to write the code. You can click on compile and run anytime to check compilation/execution status. The code should be logically/syntactically correct.
# Question: Write a program in C such that it takes a lower limit and upper limit as inputs and print all the intermediate pallindrome numbers.
# TestCase 1:
# Input:
# 10,80
# Expected Result:
# 11,22,33, 44, 55, 66, 77.
# Test Case 2:
# Input:
# 100,200
# Expected Result:
# 101, 111, 121, 131, 141, 151, 161, 171, 181, 191.
